# eye-maze-v2.0
For this project I used: Spring(java) + React(ts)
This is a pvp game where you should escape from a maze and collect coins by controlling your character with eyes.The players who has the most coins gained wins.
The game is under development but currently has features like lobbies, custom maps, match stats and more.
 Iâ€™ve also created a demo version single player version in which your enemies are monsters, the time that you need to finish the maze is measured and the coins decrease that time.
